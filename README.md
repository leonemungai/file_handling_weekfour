The following code:

Prompts the user for the name of a file to read.

Handles errors if the file is not found (FileNotFoundError) or any I/O issue occurs.

Modifies the content (in this case: converts everything to uppercase â€” you can customize this).

Writes the modified content to a new file specified by the user.
